## Onramp

This folder contains selected exercises and notes from MATLAB Onramp.

Purpose:
- Establish MATLAB syntax fluency
- Become comfortable with vectors, matrices, scripts, and plotting

This folder is not meant to demonstrate numerical methods or physics
modeling. It serves only as the foundational layer upon which later
topics are built.

Progress
 - [x]Basic Scripting
 - [x]vectors and matrixes
 - [x]Array Indexing and calc
 - [x]function calls and documentation
 - [x]plots
 - [x]logical arrays 
 - [x]Programming 
 - [curr]Final Proj

Outcome:
After completing this folder, MATLAB syntax should not be a bottleneck
when studying numerical methods.
