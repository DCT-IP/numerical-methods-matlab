# Numerical methods matlab

This repository documents my MATLAB learning journey with an emphasis on
numerical methods and physics-based simulations.

It builds upon MATLAB Onramp and progresses through:
- Linear systems
- Root finding
- Ordinary differential equation (ODE) simulation

Each topic is implemented in a structured, from-scratch manner before
using MATLAB's built-in solvers.

## Folder Structure

- `onramp/` – Core MATLAB syntax and matrix operations
- `linear_systems/` – Solving Ax = b, least squares, conditioning
- `root_finding/` – Bisection, Newton, Secant, and `fzero`
- `ode_simulation/` – Euler, RK4, `ode45`, and physics models

## Philosophy

The goal is not just to use MATLAB solvers, but to understand:
- the underlying numerical methods
- stability and error behavior
- physical interpretation of results

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2022a or later (no toolboxes required)
